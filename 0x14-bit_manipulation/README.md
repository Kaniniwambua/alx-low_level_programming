it Manipulation Project (C)
This simple C project provides basic explanations and examples of common bit manipulation operations.

Overview
Bit manipulation involves operations at the binary level, manipulating individual bits in binary representations of data. This project includes explanations and examples for common bitwise operations.

Bitwise AND
The bitwise AND operator (&) performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding bits of two integers. It returns a new integer with bits set to 1 only if the corresponding bits in both operands are 1.

Bitwise OR
The bitwise OR operator (|) performs a bitwise OR operation between corresponding bits of two integers. It returns a new integer with bits set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1.

Bitwise XOR
The bitwise XOR operator (^) performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation between corresponding bits of two integers. It returns a new integer with bits set to 1 only if the corresponding bits in the operands are different.

Left Shift
The left shift operator (<<) shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions. This operation is equivalent to multiplying the integer by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.

Right Shift
The right shift operator (>>) shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions. For unsigned integers, this is equivalent to dividing the integer by 2 raised to the power of the shift count. For signed integers, the behavior depends on the implementation.
