File I/O 

This is a simple C program that demonstrates file input/output (I/O) operations. It shows how to write data to a file and read data from a file using standard file I/O functions in C.
Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you'll need:

    A C compiler (such as GCC or Clang) installed on your system.
    Basic knowledge of the C programming language.
    An understanding of file I/O concepts in C.

Instructions

    Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Writing to a file

    Open the main.c file in a text editor.
    Locate the main function in the file.
    Modify the code within the main function to write your desired data to a file. You can change the filename and the data being written.
    Save the changes to the main.c file.

Reading from a file

    Locate the code that reads data from the file. It is marked with comments in the main function.
    Modify the code if needed to read the desired data from the file.
    Save the changes to the main.c file.

Building and running the program

    In the terminal or command prompt, compile the program using the appropriate command. For example, with GCC:

    css

gcc main.c -o file_io

Once the program is successfully compiled, run it by executing the generated executable file. For example:

bash

./file_io

Check the output to verify that the program has written and read the file correctly.
