C File I/O Quick Guide
Overview
This concise guide introduces basic File Input and Output (I/O) operations in C using the stdio.h library. Mastering these fundamental concepts is your key to seamlessly interacting with external files.

Getting Started
Compilation:
Ensure a C compiler (like GCC) is available.

Navigate to your C file directory.

Compile with:

bash
Copy code
gcc file_io.c -o file_io
Execution:
Run the compiled executable:
bash
Copy code
./file_io
Output:
A file, example.txt, is generated.

"Hello, File I/O in C!" is written to the file.

The file's content is then read and displayed.

Notes:
Utilizes stdio.h functions for file operations.

Opens the file in write mode ("w") for initial data input.

Later opens the file in read mode ("r") for data retrieval.

Error messages are provided for troubleshooting.

Explore and Adapt:
Use this as a starting point to dive into more advanced file operations tailored to your specific needs. Happy coding!
